It’s a shame that Roblox Studio doesn’t natively support Figma imports, but with the help of this plugin, you can make the import process easier!

The plugin is designed with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that speeds up your UI/UX workflow, and retains your original creation across all screen resolutions and devices.
